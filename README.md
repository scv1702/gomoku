This is the console-based gomoku game that two users can enjoy.

## What is the gomoku?
> Gomoku, also called Five in a Row, is an abstract strategy board game. 
> It is traditionally played with Go pieces (black and white stones) on a Go board. 
> It is played using a 15×15 board while in the past a 19×19 board was standard.
> Because pieces are typically not moved or removed from the board, gomoku may also be played as a paper-and-pencil game. 
> The game is known in several countries under different names. - **wikipedia**

## Rule
1. The color of the stone is black or white.
2. Players alternate turns placing a stone of their color on an empty intersection.
3. Black plays first.
4. The winner is the first player to form an unbroken chain of five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
5. If the player does nothing for 30 seconds, the player will lose.
